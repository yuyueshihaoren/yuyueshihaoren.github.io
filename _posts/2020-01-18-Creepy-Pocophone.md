# Pocophone F1
Pocophone F1 is a international sub-brand of a Chinese smart phone company Xiaomi
and it is using the international version of its Android ROM: MIUI.
This phone went viral around late 2018. It has almost every single piece of feature
that defines a "Flagship" smartphone at a very low price point.

The experience of using this phone is pretty good, until...

# Conversations comes out of nowhere during my sleep!
I am a international student from China. When I was at home in China in January,
I heard a conversation in my dream.
Then I was waken up and realized it wasn't a dream - it was my phone.
There wasn't any app running at the foreground.
The conversation sounded like some people in the airport.
I could hear the broadcast.
As I swipe up, the sound disappeared. I ignored it, hoping that it had been a dream.

The it came again.
I recorded this creepy stuff with my tablet and upload it to YouTube.

# Not only in China!
I am back to school (in U.S.) now, and I heard it again!
The conversation is of an American accent telling her ID number of some kind.
This time, I am more suspicious of the calendar app.
Just as in the video I shot last time, the creepy conversation happened when there was a calendar notification.
I am not sure if it is the issue of MIUI's calendar or Google calendar (I have both installed).

It's very creepy and make me feel insecure. I hope Xiaomi or Google can pay some attention to it.
